        <p> Sung Jinwoo (성진우, Seong Jin-Wu) is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. He is the strongest hunter in the world and the second Shadow Monarch, having inherited the position from his predecessor Ashborn.

            Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, Jinwoo got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter and the second Shadow Monarch.

            Appearance
            Jinwoo is a tall, handsome, and muscular young man with gray eyes, sharp facial features, and black hair with bangs that dangle all the way down to his eyes. When using his powers or feeling intense emotions, his eyes glow purple and his facial features become more pronounced. He favors dark clothing and often seen in sleek, sharp outfits ranging from tailored suits to long hooded coats. After defeating the Monarchs in the revised timeline created by the Cup of Reincarnation, he also starts wearing a black glove on his left hand to cover up the burn scars that he received there during his rematch with Antares.[3]
            
            Before he was chosen as the Player of the System, Jinwoo had a very different appearance. He was shorter and had a noticeably thinner physique, with long, bushy hair that covered up his ears. His face was very boyish, which made him look even younger than his sister Jinah (who was still a teenager at the time), and he tended to dress in casual attire, favoring a simple blue hoodie and jeans. It was also common to see him wearing bandages on his arms and legs due to the frequent injuries that he received on raids.
